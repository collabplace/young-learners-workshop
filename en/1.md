# What is programming (coding)?

Set of instructions given to a computer to perform a computation task.

## Communication

Talk to the computer with a simple command

```py
print('hi')
```

## Set of instructions

Computer can run a set of instructions

```py
print('hi')
a = 10
print(a)
```

# Variables

## Step 1 - Variable assignment

Numbers... as integers
```py
age = 20
```

Text... as strings
```py
school_name = 'ZPHS Mansoorabad'
```

Variables can be updated with different values

```py
age = 22
school_name = 'Siddhi Vinayaka School'
```

## Step 2 - Addition of numbers

```py
number_one = 30
number_two = 20
addition_result = number_one + number_two

print(addition_result)
```

## Step 3 - Subtraction of numbers

```py
number_one = 30
number_two = 20
subtraction_result = number_one - number_two

print(subtraction_result)
```

## Step 4 - Multiplication of numbers

```py
number_one = 10
number_two = 20
multiplication_result = number_one * number_two

print(multiplication_result)
```

## Step 5 - Power

Let's calculate 2 power 2...
```py
two_power_two = 2 * 2
print(two_power_two)
```

Let's calculate 2 power 10...
```py
two_power_ten = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
print(two_power_ten)
```

- this can lead to errors
- we can simplify this...

### Using a library

```py
import math

two_power_two = math.pow(2, 2)
```

Let's calculate 2 power 3...
```py
two_power_three = math.pow(2, 3)
```

Let's calculate 2 power 4...
```py
two_power_four = math.pow(2, 4)
```
